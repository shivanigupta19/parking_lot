<p>Designed a system that can hold cars of different colors and registration numbers. The system will issue a parking ticket to each car and assign a parking spot based on proximity to the entry point. Additionally, the system will support various queries such as retrieving registration numbers of cars of a particular color, finding the ticket number for a given registration number, and retrieving ticket numbers for cars of a specific color.</p>

<br>

<h2>Parking Lot Design - </h2>
<p>The parking lot consists of a fixed number of parking spots, each identified by a unique spot number.
Spots may vary in size to accommodate different types of vehicles (e.g., compact, standard, or oversized).
The parking lot will have an entry point for cars to enter and an exit point for cars to exit.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Ticket Generation - </h2>
<p>When a car enters the parking lot, a unique ticket is generated for that car.
Each ticket should include the ticket number and the timestamp when it was issued.</p>

<br>

<h2>Car Registration and Allocation - </h2>
<p>When a car enters the parking lot, the system records its details, including color and registration number.
The system assigns the car to the nearest available parking spot based on an algorithm that calculates proximity to the entry point.
</p>

<br>

<h3>The query engine provides the following functionality:</h3>
<ul><b>Registration Numbers by Color</b> - Users can query the system to retrieve the registration numbers of all cars of a particular color.</ul>
<ul><b>Ticket Number by Registration Number</b> -  Users can find the ticket number associated with a given registration number.</ul>
<ul><b>Ticket Numbers by Color</b> -  Users can retrieve the ticket numbers of all tickets where a car of a particular color is parked.</ul>
